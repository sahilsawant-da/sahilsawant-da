# 👋 Hi, I’m @sahilsawant-da

I'm a passionate Computer Engineer (B.E. - 2024) actively working at the intersection of **AI/ML**, **backend development**, and **real-time systems**. I build scalable, intelligent, and practical applications using Python, FastAPI, and deep learning frameworks.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in
- **Machine Learning**, **AI/ML**, and **Data Science**
- Time-series forecasting and anomaly detection
- Building real-world **AI/ML systems**
- Designing intelligent **FastAPI-based backend solutions**
- Working on **distributed, scalable apps** using cloud-native practices
- Real-time monitoring and predictive analytics using historical data

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- **XGBoost, LSTM** for time-series forecasting and real-time prediction
- **Matrix Profile**, various algorithm and forecasting techniques for time-series similarity and anomaly detection as well as predictions
- Advanced **FastAPI** patterns with PostgreSQL and Docker
- High-performance **data wrangling** with Pandas and Polars
- Scaling APIs using **async features and microservice architecture**

---

## 💼 Projects I’m proud of
### 🔹 Sentiment Analysis API (Multilingual)(https://github.com/sahilsawant-da/sentiment-analysis-api)
A FastAPI-based NLP web service using `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` for real-time sentiment analysis in **English, Hindi, and Marathi**.
- Filters comments by sentiment (positive/negative)
- Generates **live pie chart visualizations**
- Production-ready CORS handling and error logging
- Deployed with `uvicorn` and ready for frontend integration

### 🔹 Laptop Health Monitoring + Forecasting
An intelligent time-series system to:
- Monitor live laptop metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) every 5 seconds
- Predict future health using **XGBoost and LSTM**
- Visualize real vs predicted health metrics using **matplotlib** in Jupyter
- Entirely modular with historical logging, live updates, and future forecasting

### 🔹 Time-Series Matrix Profile Analysis
A project (in progress) that:
- Applies **matrix profile** to identify motifs, anomalies, and patterns in time-series laptop health data
- Aims to enhance early failure detection
- Will integrate into live monitoring for **automated insight detection**

### 🔹 Backend for Vendor Management System
- Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Alembic (migrations), Docker
- Handles secure credential storage and verification
- Role-based user handling and encrypted API communication

---

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Open-source AI/ML tools or visual analytics dashboards
- Sentiment analysis for regional or low-resource languages
- Backend systems with real-time prediction and monitoring
- Deep learning research or projects related to edge deployment
